title: How to Create a Personal Site in 5 Minutes
---

{{ page.title }}
================

This is the first entry of my new blog. This post serves as a meta blog, which tells the story of how the blog comes into being.

The title is a little bit exaggerated, actually it takes less than 1 minute.

This site is totally hosted in Github, the repository name is [vinjn/vinjn.github.io](https://github.com/vinjn/vinjn.github.io). Each Github user can create his/her personal site.

-----------------------------------------------------

Let me tell the story.

- First of all, you should have a Github account. I will certainly not make friends with you if you are unfamiliar with Github.   
- Open [vinjn/vinjn.github.io](https://github.com/vinjn/vinjn.github.io) and **FORK ME** .  
- It should be forked to https://github.com/**whoareyou**/**vinjn**.github.io. Since you  are not me, so you should not use my name, right? If you say yes, then click *Settings* and rename the project to **whoareyou**.github.io.

You can now open whoareyou.github.io, of couse you will see a big 404. Why? Because you have not changed a single line of the source codes. Only after you committed changes to the repository, will Github server actually generate the site for you.

- index.html is the best place to start with, cast some html magic and commit it to server.

- If you are lucky enough, [whoareyou.github.io](http://whoareyou.github.io) is online and the story is over.
- If not, ask Google.
